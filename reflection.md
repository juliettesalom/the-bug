## Assignment update reflection

Having worked on my creative piece assignment over the last few weeks, The Bug is in its final stages of completion. 

Background image/colours:
Selecting an appropriate background image has been a bit of trial and error in working out what colours and patterns are appropriate for my Twine story, needing one that isn't too distracting from the text in the foreground, but not so boring or plain that it has no effect to the aesthetics of the story. I originally intended to use a bright pink or purple colour for the text, which worked with my original background image of a black blank computer screen illustration. However, this image felt a little too childish, not suited to the tone of my story. I found this pink/blue 90's style desktop background screensaver which works great aesthetically, however it means the most appropriate colour of my type is to be white. Although a bit boring, accessibility in being able to read the text is more important than what colour the text is.

Font/text: 
After having a few issues in trying to change the font of the text in my story, I finally was able to work out how to import a font style from the internet into my Twine story. The font style I have chosen is a robotic, code-looking style to suit the digital nature of the plot of my piece. I think this style works the best because it is both easy to read and suits my piece aesthetically.

Story:
The story of my Twine piece hasn't changed all too much from the original story outline I designed, beside from me adding some more alternative routes to the story, creating more paths to the maze for the reader/user to stumble down. I've also included a 'back to start' option at the end of each path, allowing the reader/user to begin the story again if they find themselves at a dead end. 

Sound:
I've added sound to almost every passage of my Twine story, being a consistent ticking clock sound that is used to create a sense of urgencey, whilst also immersing the reader/user into the story. The story world of my piece is important in encouraging the reader to feel like they are as much as part of the story as they are reading it, and sound only adds to this sensation.

To do:
- [x] change the colour of the option text on the passages from blue to something else more readable
- [x] test my story with people who haven't seen it before to get their reactions/suggestions/notes
