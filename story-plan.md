## Story plan

- Reader is tasked to fixing the Y2K bug before the clock runs out and the year ticks over to 2000. If they don't fix the bug, the computers could take over the world and start the computer apocalypse.
- The story will eventually divide into two routes: 1- the bug is being fixed and order is restored, the year 2000 comes and all is ok; 2- the bug isn't fixed in time and the computer apocalypse begins, the computers hold the internet and all technology captive, the user has the choice to joining forces with the computer army or dying. Joining the computer army will also lead to death. 
- Because the story will be framed in that there is a countdown until the year 2000, the amount of minutes until midnight of December 31 1999 may be a good measure for time for how long the creative piece should be. 5 minutes? I'd love there to be a countdown clock, so it really is a race to the end for the user.
- There's only one path to go forward on, wrong options will always eventually lead to death.
- According to the Wikipedia page, there were six different approaches used to solve the Y2K bug. Only after User does all six of these solutions will the bug be fixed and the apocalypse avoided.
- The way the story will be structured will be around the idea of 5 minutes left. Within each minute to go, there is a bug that needs to be fixed in order to progress to the next minute. In each minute there will be two or three steps, and at each step there will be a right or wrong way to go forward. 
- This will mean that there will be about 20ish passages to the end of the story if the user only chooses the correct steps, however altogether there will be about 30-35 passages, including wrong steps taken and explanation passages
- Twine will be used as this will be the easiest and most logical program in which to enact this story. I probably also feel the most comfortable with Twine.

Story beats/story outline:
- User is told the situation: 5 minutes until the year 2000, only they can fix the bug in time to stop the computer apocalypse from taking beginning and destroying the human world.

With 5 minutes to go, the User has to make it through the first two solutions:
- User can try to turn their computer off and on again. This doesn't work.
- User can go make a sandwich (this is going to be hungry work) OR call a friend for help.
- Making a sandwich: User brings back sandwich. Time runs out, the bug isn't fixed. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Call a friend: You ring your good friend, Bill Gates, and ask him what he'd do. He says that if anyone knew what to do about the Y2K bug, it'd be you, User. You thank Bill for his kind yet unhelpful words and hang up the phone.
- User has the option to not worry about the dates getting muddled up OR install software kits and bridge programs into all computers.
- Not worry about the dates getting muddled up: User has the option to go to their friend's NYE party OR watch the countdown on their desktop computer, in anticipation of the apocalypse.
- Go to NYE party: before User can even put on both their shoes, the clock ticks over to year 2000, the Y2K bug isn't fixed and the computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Watch countdown: the clock ticks over to year 2000, the Y2K bug isn't fixed and the computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Install: User quickly installs all the required software kits and bridge programs into all the computers in the world from their desktop. This seems to work, meaning there are only four solutions left to be solved before the clock hits midnight.

With 4 minutes to go: 
- User has the option to freak out, not know what to do, try calling Bill again OR stop and try to think of the purest and most simple way to solving this problem.
- Call Bill: Bill doesn't answer, User has wasted the precious minutes they have left. The freak out even more. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Stop and try to think: User has an idea that could possibly work but could also be a waste of precious time. They could, quite simply, expand the year date of all the computers in the world. 
- User has the option to look out the window for last minute inspiration OR look into expanding the year date to a four-digit number.
- Out the window: User gets lost in thought and before they know it it has been 4 minutes, midnight has come. User watches as all the traffic lights start to flash and the lights go out. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Expanding the year date: User enacts the first and purest solution by expanding the two-digit year dates to four-digits in all programs, files and databases. Although it will cost governments around the world millions of dollars, User is another step closer to fixing the bug.

With 3 minutes to go:
- User has the option to call their loved ones to say goodye, just in case OR take another sip of their orange Fanta fizzy drink and keep working.
- Call loved ones: No one picks up, they're all too busy getting ready to celebrate the new millenium. But they'll never make it there. User has used up the last few minutes. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Take a sip: that Fanta gives User the burst of energy they need. They're more determined than ever to fix this bug.
- User has the option to take one more sip of their Fanta fizzy drink, because damn it's yummy OR try installing small patches of code into programs so to temporarily fix the date windows. This date windowing mean the two-digit years can be retained and only programs that need to determine the century value can for particular functions. 
- Take one more sip: Oh no! Powered by the obscene energy of the sugar in the drink, User has erratically knocked over the rest of their Fanta and it's now seeping into their desktop computer. The computer fizzles, before snapping to black. Time runs out. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Attempt to date window: This works successfully! Now all the computers in the world can also remain as two digit years if they wish, thanks to User. One more bug solved and one minute closer to the year 2000.

With 2 minutes to go:
- User is feeling like they have everything under control. User has the option to check their email OR crack their fingers as they stretch their arms in front of their computer screen and get back to work.
- Check email: User finds only 1 new email, from their mother. User never finds out what it says, it takes too long to load. Time has run out. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Crack fingers and get back to work: User remembers that there is such a thing called date compression, where the date can be compressed into 14 binary numbers. User has the option to try date compression OR light up a ciggie to try and relax.
- Light up a ciggie: As User goes to light, they drop the match onto their desktop and the whole thing catches on fire. Time runs out. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Try date compression: It works! Thanks to this technique of data structure alignment User can move on to the last bug, with only 1 minute to go.

With 1 minute to go:
- Everything's looking pretty optimistic. User has the option to put on their silly year 2000 novelty glasses so to get in the spirit of things OR get a bottle of champagne from the fridge, ready to pop.
- Champagne from fridge: User gets greedy and pops the bottle before midnight. Naughty! With only seconds left to fix the last bug, User spends these precious moments guzzling sparkling wine instead. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Put on silly year 2000 novelty glasses: Looking good. With the boost of determination these glasses give User to make it to the year 2000, they keep working away at that final bug.
- User has the option to get distracted and also put on low-rise denim jeans and one of those colourful baseball caps, in preparation for the party they'll be going to when they fix this last bug OR stare at the computer screen until an idea pops into their head of how to fix this.
- Put on jeans and hat: Although User looks good, they've wasted their last minute to save the world. No celebration for them, no matter how good they look. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Stare at computer screen: User finally thinks of an idea! They could try date re-partitioning, using to code to convert to three-digit years and three-digit days. Does User try this method of date re-partitioning OR fall asleep on the keyboard, with only seconds to go.
- Fall asleep: Time runs out. The computer apocalypse begins. The computers take over, User is the first to go.
- Try date re-partitioning: It works! The final bug is fixed, and just in time!

- As the clock strikes midnight, User welcomes the new millenium with a tired smile. They put their novelty glasses away and save the champagne for another time. User falls onto the ground with relief and crawls across the room to their bed. They fall asleep into a deep and uninterupted slumber, sleeping well knowing the computer apocalypse was so closely missed.
